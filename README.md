## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- 🌾 **AI-driven precision agriculture** (crop stress, irrigation, nutrient optimization)
- 🛰️ **Spectral intelligence & remote sensing** (RGB → hyperspectral insights)
- 🤖 **Agricultural robotics** (autonomous navigation, sensing, and actuation)
- 📱 **Smart irrigation systems** (mobile apps, IoT, Bluetooth/SMS control)
- 🧠 **Physics-informed machine learning** (PROSAIL, crop models, AI + domain knowledge)

## 🌍 Why I Do This
> *Technology should not widen the gap between farmers with resources and those without.  
It should close it.*

My work is driven by **food security**, **climate resilience**, and **equitable access to advanced technologies**, especially across the Global South.
